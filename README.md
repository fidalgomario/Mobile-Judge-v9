# Mobile-Judge-9.0

Mobile Judge aims to ease the process of inviting judges from industry and academia to the showcase event at the end of each semester. Potential judges will receive invitations and are able to accept/decline the invitation. At the day of the event, they will be able to use their own handheld devices to learn about which students are assigned to them, where to find them in the room, and enter their evaluation for the students work. As for the administrator features, it allows for syncing students to the application, editing judges/students information, manage invitations/grades, and gather information from all aspects of the users.
